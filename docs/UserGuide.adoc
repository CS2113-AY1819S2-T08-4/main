== Introduction

FOP Manager is a desktop Graphical User Interface (GUI) address book app, specifically designed for *NUS Freshman Orientation Camp Organizers* to manage the contact information of camp participants: both Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs) and Freshmen. It is optimized for those who prefer to work with a *Command Line Interface* (CLI). If you can type fast, FOP Manager can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
