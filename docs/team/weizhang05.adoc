== INTRODUCTION:

---

Hello! My name is Wei Zhang but you may call me Clyde for short. I'm currently a second year student in NUS School
 of Computing, pursuing a Bachelor of Computing in Information Security. +
 +
At the time when this document was created (over a period of Jan 2019 to April 2019),
 I took *CS2113T (Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming)* and *CCS2101 Effective Communication
  for Computing Professionals*, which requires me to develop a desktop application and write documentations for it
   as part of the curriculum. +
 +
I held various roles in the development of this project which includes *designing the application architecture*,
 *developing core features*, *code integration* and *testing*. +
 +
Aside from this project, I'm also a self-taught *Cyber Security Practitioner* where my main interests are
 *Penetration Testing* and *Digital Forensics*.

== ABOUT:

---

The purpose of this document is to showcase the contribution of my work towards this
 project as part of the learning in this module. +
 +
The outline of this document will be listed as follows, mainly describing the work I have done in both technical
 and non-technical aspect:

* *Summary of Contributions*: Describes mainly the technical aspect of work I have contributing in the development
 of the project. It also includes any other possible contributions I have done that may not be technical. +
* *Contributions to User Guide*: Showcases my ability in writing a guide for user of
 the application that was developed for. +
* *Contributions to Developer Guide*: Showcases my ability in writing a guide for developers who may continue
 to work on the development and maintenance of the application in the future.

== PROJECT: FOP Manager

---

== Overview

FOP Manager is a desktop application developed for NUS undergraduate students who are Project Directors
 of *Freshmen Orientation Programs* to manage both participants and committee members of the program.
  The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
   It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC. The development of this application is to teach
    Principles of Software Engineering, which is part of the context of CS2113T.

== Summary of contributions
This segment showcase my contribution to both the development of the application and
 the documentation of the project. +

|Randomize Command	                    |A command that allows the Project Director to automatically assign all participants to created groups.	|This allows the Project Director to automatically assigns all participants to created group at a random distribution without doing it manually.	|The challenge here is to come out with a suitable algorithm which ensure even distribution and no possible loop holes (e.g. all OGLs in 1 group).
|Redesign Model and Storage component   |Redesigning the way the application stores and manages data                                     	|This enables the storing and managing of house and groups on top of the current participants. 						|The challenge here is figuring out how is the whole application designed as this modification requires knowing the code base very well.

|Input box is clear after every command execution 	|Simulate a Terminal/CMD (i.e. Command line Interface in Windows/Linux) interface which clears the input segment after every entering of commands (i.e. text is cleared when the user hits the 'enter' button).    |This improves the user friendliness of using the command line as the target users prefers using CLI (Command line Interface) over GUI (Graphical User Interface).  |The challenge here is to figure out the code for the UI component and ensuring which part of it is to be placed. This include ensuring the fix works as well.
