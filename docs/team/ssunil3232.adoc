== PROJECT: **__FOP Manager__**

---

== About the Project

For our Software Engineering module CS2113T, my team and I worked on morphing a given Command Line Interface (CLI) Address book for its **use by Faculty Orientation Program (FOP) Project Directors for easier management of participant data during camps**.

Here is how the FOP Manager looks like:

image::Ui.png[width="790"]

=== Purpose of the Project
Often it gets messy during the facilitation and organisation of FOP camps as the FOP participant size is a lot larger than normal camps and there are various critical student data that need to be passed around among organizers. __FOP Manager__ will aid FOP Project Directors in viewing, sharing and changing the participant data more easily.

=== My Role
**My role** was to design features that will enable the separate listing of Freshmen, Orientation Group Leaders (OGL) and other participants in the camp, such as Organisers, from the contact list stored on FOP Manager. I was also tasked to do an export feature to export the all participants', all Freshmen's and all OGLs' data from the contact list into an Excel spreadsheet. For more conveninet adding of multiple contacts, I was also tasked to do an import feature. Hence, I contributed the `add_f`, `add_o`, `list_f`, `list_o`, `export`, `export_f`, `export_o` and `import` features in the FOP Manager.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation and other contributions to the team project.

* *Major enhancements*:
** *Feature 1*: __Listing of Freshmen and Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs)__
*** *Format*: `list_f`, `list_o`
*** *Purpose*: To distinguish among the freshmen, the OGLs and other participants involved in the camp from the full contact list.
*** *Justification*: This command will help the FOP Project Directors to clearly see the participants in the list of freshmen involved, the list of OGLs involved and the list of other participants involved. It will also display the number of participants in each list to give the user an idea of the expected camp size and accordingly manage the logistics.
*** *Highlights*: This enhancement is a good to have feature for future enhancements where we need to pull out separate lists. The implementation tactfully used the understanding and flow of the Addressbook commands, reducing need for extensive lines of code.
*** *Code contributed*: [LINK of Pull Requests: https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-t08-4/main/pull[#83], https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-t08-4/main/pull[#81], https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-t08-4/main/pull[#80], https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-t08-4/main/pull[#55]]

** *Feature 2*: __Exporting of data to an Excel file__
*** *Format*: `export`, `export_f`, `export_o`
*** *Purpose*: To export the data in the contact list to Excel spreadsheets, a form shareable with other organisers involved in the camp and others without access to FOP Manager. To also export the data of Freshmen and OGLs as separate lists as well.
*** *Justification*: This command is necessary for other organizers and non-organisers to be able to view the contacts, without altering the data stored in the FOP Manager. It will also allow the FOP Project Directors to share the contact list information to others without access to the FOP Manager. The export function will work hand-in-hand with the import function, to ensure there are multiple saved copies of the full contact list.
*** *Highlights*: This enhancement required the integration of a third-party library. Basic understanding of the usage of the library was sufficient for the implementation of this feature.
*** *Code contributed*: [LINK of Pull Requests: https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-t08-4/main/pull[#97], https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-t08-4/main/pull[#140], https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-t08-4/main/pull[#144]]

** *Feature 3*: __Importing of data from an Excel file__
*** *Format*: `import`
*** *Purpose*: To import contacts from an Excel spreadsheet, an easier way to add multiple contacts into the FOP Manager without needing to enter the `add` command continuously. It also allows for saving and loading of the contact list, by working hand-in-hand with the `export` command.
*** *Justification*: This command is necessary to reduce the manual keying the FOP Project Director has to do to add contacts into the FOP Manager. It will also allow the FOP Project Director to load previous data exported from the FOP Manager, in case the Project Director losses the contact details from the FOP Manager. Thus, it is also purposeful in acting as a Back-up method.
*** *Highlights*: This enhancement required the integration of a third-party library. Basic understanding of the usage of the library was sufficient for the implementation of this feature.
*** *Code contributed*: [LINK of Pull Requests: https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-t08-4/main/pull[#143]]

* *Minor enhancement*:
** *Feature*: __Adding of freshmen and Orientation Group Leaders(OGLs)__
*** *Format*: `add_f`, `add_o`
*** *Purpose*: To add a freshman and an OGL, respectively to the contact list.
*** *Justification*: This command will help the FOP Project Directors to add a tag to the freshmen and the OGLs respectively, without the need to type out the tag "Freshman" or "OGL". The feature will automatically save the Freshman and OGL added with their respective tags.
*** *Highlights*: It was a necessary enhancement to implement for the various listing commands to work the way they were implemented.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|_I added the sections on Participant Management, the Export Feature and the Import Feature to the FOP Manager Developer Guide. The following section is an example contribution of the Participant Management section I wrote on in the Developer Guide and sample of the Export Feature and Import Feature sections. You can view the Export Feature and the Import Feature in greater detail from the Developer Guide._
|===

=== Participant Management

Participant management refers to how users manipulate and view the data of camp participants. Participants are categorised into 3 types: OGL, Freshman or other.

This section describes how the 3 types of participants are managed.

In *FOP Manager*, participants can be added, edited, deleted and listed.

Add

* `add_o`: Adds an OGL type participant
* `add_f`: Adds a Freshman type participant
* `add`: Adds a participant who is neither OGL nor Freshman

Participant contact details can be viewed in different manners:

* `list`: Lists all participants in the camp
* `list_o`: Lists all OGLs
* `list_f`: Lists all Freshmen

All participants are stored in the same contact list as a `UniqueParticipantList` in an AddressBook object. Participants created as OGLs or Freshmen differ only in the tags added to them. The different listing of the participants is very useful for Project Directors as it helps them to view the Freshmen and the OGL contacts separately, to specifically see who are in the respective lists and how many participants are there in each of the lists.

==== Current Implementation

The list commands, `list_o` and `list_f`, use the keywords/predicates "Freshman" and "OGL" to search through the tags of all participants in the contact list. All participants with matching tags of "Freshman" or "OGL" will be added into the filtered participant list, enabling the user to view all freshmen or OGLs in the contact list.

The following Sequence diagram below will explain how the `list_f` command works in detail.

image::ListParticipantCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Sequence Diagram for listing Freshmen command_

An example usage of the `list_f` command is as follows:

*Step 1:* The user launches the application. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state.

*Step 2:* The user enters the `list_f` command . The `list_f` command calls the `FindingParticipantPredicate` class and searches all tags of each person for "Freshman".

*Step 3:* The `updateFilteredPersonList()` takes in this predicate and the `getFilteredPersonList()` is called to give the list of Freshmen in the contact list

The implementation is similar for the `list_o` command with the use of `FindingOglPredicate` instead where the searched tag is "OGL".

==== Design Considerations
This section elaborates on the possible ways for implementation that were considered and explains the analysis process of finally choosing the method of implementation.

===== Aspect: Separate management of freshmen and OGLs

[options="header"]
|=======================
| 													|Pros 																						|Cons
|*Alternative 1*: Create 2 separate lists containing freshmen and OGLs separately, in addition to a full list containing all participants.	|Less computationally expensive to obtain separate lists of freshmen and OGLs.    |Involves greater code complexity to update any contact details, with greater room for error, and requires more memory and storage.
|*Alternative 2* __(current choice)__: Store all participants in the same list.	|Smaller code base needed, and allows for participants who are neither OGLs nor Freshmen (such as camp directors or camp commandants) to be added.    |More computationally expensive to access lists of freshmen and lists of OGLs.  |
|=======================

We decided to go ahead with *Alternative 1* as it was easier to implement. It would not require creation of switch cases for the UI to display the respective lists and would not require unnecessarily long codes to filter out freshmen and OGLs from the participant list. The pros of doing *Alternative 1* outweighs the pros of doing *Alternative 2* hence the decision to implement the latter.

=== Export feature

The Export feature will allow the FOP Manager user to export the data into an excel file and distribute to other relevant people involved in the FOP. This way, data can be distributed and raw data untouched except by the Project Director or other camp organisers who are given the access to the raw data.

Participant contact details can be exported in different manners:

* `export`: Exports all participants' contacts into an Excel Spreadsheet
* `export_f`: Exports all freshmen contacts into an Excel Spreadsheet
* `export_o`: Exports all OGL contacts into an Excel Spreadsheet

==== Current Implementation
* A third-party library 'Apache.poi' was integrated into the project to enable easy creation of excel files through Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In this case, the library will enable the creation of HSSF Workbook.
* The `export` command will call a function from a class `WriteToExcel` to start the creation of the HSSF Workbook and the addition of all the participants found on the participant list to the Workbook, with the respective objects to the participant class added to the correct column. The system will get the current directory path and add the path name to the proposed file name that end with ".xls". The file will thus be successfully saved in the current user directory.

==== Design Consideration
Only one way was considered for the implementation of Export feature, which involved importing the third-party library.

The example usage and Sequence Diagram of the command can be found in the **Developer Guide's Export Feature** section under _Implementation_.
Link to view the Developer Guide: [https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T08-4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[Developer Guide]]

=== Import Feature

Sometimes FOP Project Directors realise they need to add many participants' contacts that they gathered and usually they gather the contacts through sign up links that allow for exportation into Excel spreadsheets. Manually added the large influx of participants is troublesome. Hence, with the Import feature, FOP Project Directors can import the data of Non-duplicate people from an excel file into the FOP Manager. This makes adding of contacts easier.

==== Current Implementation
* A third-party library 'Apache.poi' was integrated into the project to enable easy creation of excel files through Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In this case, the library will enable the creation of HSSF Workbook.
* The `import` command will call a function from a class `WriteToExcel` to start the reading from a HSSF Workbook found in the current directory path, with the file name "FOP_MANAGER_LIST.xls".
* The cell value from the respective heading/columns are read into their respective string and `person` is created with these strings.
* The `person` is added to a `List<Person>` and each `person` is added into the `Address Book`.

==== Design Consideration
Only one way was considered for the implementation of Import feature, which involved importing the third-party library.

The example usage and Sequence Diagram of the command can be found in the **Developer Guide's Import Feature** section under _Implementation_.
