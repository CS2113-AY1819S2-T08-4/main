Hello! I am a Year 2 Computer Engineering student studying in the National University of Singapore (NUS). As someone rather new to the industry, I am always excited to learn and experience new things. I have done both hardware and software projects in my last 2 years in university, and in this document I will be showing you a portfolio of my contributions to my team's Software Engineering project over this semester.

== PROJECT: _FOP Manager_

---

== About The Project

My team and I decided to enhance an existing Command Line Interface address book application to manage camp participants' information, to be used by NUS Freshmen Orientation Camp Project Directors (PDs). This enhanced application allows PDs to view and modify participants' contact details with ease.

In this project, I was in charge of creating the commands that support the addition and modification of groups and houses.

== About This Document

This document showcases the features I did, samples of my code, as well as relevant sections I added to the User and Developer Guides.

In this document, the following styles and formatting have been used:

****

NOTE: This symbol indicates important information.

`add_g`: Grey highlight indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application.

`_Group_`: Italicised words in grey highlight indicate the name of a class or object used in the application.

== Summary of Contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions. In this project, I was in charge of creating the logic to support our app's feature of `_Group_` and `_House_` management.

*Major enhancement*:
[options="header"]
|=======================
|Feature |Description |Justification |Highlights
|Adding, editing and deleting groups and houses |Allows the user to add, edit and delete `_House_` and `_Group_` objects, so that participants can be grouped according to their camp grouping. |Being tailored to manage participant details in Freshmen Orientation camps, having groups and houses are essential to organising participants as camp organisers normally do when planning camps. |These commands are a core component of the project that other features such as `randomize` build upon. It was challenging to implement as it required changes to basic commands like `add` and `edit`, as well as to the app's model.
|=======================

*Minor enhancements*:
[options="header"]
|=======================
|Feature |Description |Justification |Highlights

|Listing participants by houses and groups |Allows the user to list the participants in a specified house or group. |Listing the participants in the same group and same house is necessary for the user to filter through data quickly, especially when managing a large camp. It also allows the user to see the current size of a specific group or house. |The implementation of these commands required knowledge of using predicates to find participants that match a certain search criteria.

|Viewing houses and groups |Allows the user to view the houses and groups they have added so far. | The exact house or group name must be specified to edit its name, delete it, or add to it. These commands help the user to know which houses and groups have been created so far, and can therefore be added to, modified or deleted.|

|Size command| This command allows the user to view the sizing details of the camp. |This command allows the user to easily see the number of participants, OGLs, freshmen, groups and houses at one shot, providing a quick way to size the camp. |

== Contributions to the User Guide

Our team updated the original AB4 User Guide with instructions for the enhancements that we had added. In this document there are additional icons used, as shown below:

****
TIP: This is a tip. Following these suggestions will make using FOP Manager much simpler.

WARNING: This is a warning and they need to be heeded for FOP Manager to work smoothly.

The following is an excerpt from the User Guide showing the additions I made for editing `_House_` and `_Group_` objects:

=== Editing Houses and Groups
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=editgrouphouse]

=== Deleting Groups and Houses
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=deletegrouphouse]

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

Shown below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide. They showcase my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project.
