== PROJECT: FOP Manager

---

== Overview

FOP Manager is a desktop Address Book application made for Project Directors organizing the NUS School of Computing Freshman Orientation Program (FOP). The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

I was in charge of the UI aspect of the application, and designed and implemented the `stat` feature. The following section will describe these enhancements in more details, as well as showcasing all the relevant sections I have added to the user guide and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

Please take notes of the following icons and their meanings used in the document:

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: implemented *the `stat` and 'save' feature*
** What it does: The `stat` command will generate three pie charts of all of the camp's participants' age, major and sex and display them on the GUI as in Figure 1. The `save` command will save those charts into separate image files.
** Justification: At the end of every FOP, the Project Directors usually have to make various reports for their university, their faculty or different sponsors that requires these information. The `stat` and `save` features together
will let the user generate those data quickly and efficiently.
** Highlights: This enhancement touched on the logic, model ,and UI components. A new `CustomPieChart` class was created to improve code readability.
** Credits: Some parts of the `stat` command was inspired by Part 6 of the excellent https://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-tutorial/part6/[Java FX Tutorial] by Marco Jakob.
