== Introduction
Welcome to the *FOP Manager* Developer Guide!

*FOP Manager* was created for the purpose of easing the management of camp participants' contact information, where participants include Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs), Freshmen and other participants such as admin in the camp. As a text-based (Command Line Interface) address book application, *FOP Manager* is optimized for users who type fast and/or are learning to work efficiently with CLI tools. Despite being a text-based application, *FOP Manager* has a developed Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to view contact details in an appealing, well-organized format.

== About the Developer Guide

This developer guide provides detailed documentation on the implementation of all the various features *FOP Manager* offers. It also suggests methods for you to modify and build upon it, should you see fit.

See the table of contents above to navigate between different sections easily.

Throughout this developer guide, there will be various icons used, as shown below:

[TIP]
This is a tip. Follow these tips to aid your development of *FOP Manager*.

[NOTE]
This is a note. Read these for additional information.

[WARNING]
This is a warning. Heed these warnings to avoid making mistakes that will hamper your development efforts.

== Setting up

This section shows how to set up *FOP Manager* on your desktop and begin your development journey.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/major/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `TextResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `ChartPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a participant).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::commandStructure[]
=== Command Structure

To support multiple commands while ensuring separation of concerns, commands entered into the command box are handled by multiple classes that allow the code to be easily extended to support more commands.

==== Current Implementation

When each command is entered into the command box, the command word gets sent to the `AddressBookParser` to be identified. If the command word is valid, arguments are sent to the corresponding command parser, that parses the arguments and creates a corresponding command object to then implement the commands.

In the current implementation of *FOP Manager*, some commands are create from a parser while some are created directly when then command word is identified.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Handling unneccesary parameters

* *Alternative 1:* Ignore all unnecessary parameters and pass as arguments to the command object the number of parameters required for the command.
** Pros: Less computationaly expensive, and allows the user to make mistakes
** Cons: User's intentions may be misinterpreted and wrong commands may be executed
* *Alternative 2:* Only accept the number of parameters the command requires, nothing more and nothing less.
** Pros: Command carried out will always be the user's exact intention
** Cons: More computationally expensive, and leaves no room for user mistakes or typos
* *Alternative 3 (current choice):* Combination of Alternative 1 and Alternative 2.
** Commands that do not require parameters and do not modify data (such as list and view) ignore unnecessary parameters. Commands that require specific instructions to identify particular participants, groups or houses only accept the required number of parameters.

//end::commandStructure[]

//tag:: PartManagement[]
=== Participant Management

Participant management refers to how users manipulate and view the data of camp participants. Participants are categorised into 3 types: OGL, Freshman or other.

This section describes how the 3 types of participants are managed.

In *FOP Manager*, participants can be added, edited, deleted and listed.

Add

* `add_o`: Adds an OGL type participant
* `add_f`: Adds a Freshman type participant
* `add`: Adds a participant who is neither OGL nor Freshman

Edit

* `edit INDEX`: Edits the participant at the current `INDEX` of the list showing

Delete

* `delete INDEX`: Deletes the participant at the current `INDEX` of the list showing

Participant contact details can be viewed in different manners:

* `list`: Lists all participants in the camp
* `list_o`: Lists all OGLs
* `list_f`: Lists all Freshmen

All participants are stored in the same contact list as a `UniqueParticipantList` in an AddressBook object. Participants created as OGLs or Freshmen differ only in the tags added to them. The different listing of the participants is very useful for Project Directors as it helps them to view the Freshmen and the OGL contacts separately, to specifically see who are in the respective lists and how many participants are there in each of the lists.

==== Current Implementation

The following is an Activity Diagram to summarize what happens when either the `list_f` or `list_o` commands are entered.

image::ListFreshmenCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Activity Diagram for listing Freshmen command_

The list commands, `list_o` and `list_f`, use the keywords/predicates "OGL" and "Freshman", respectively, to search through the tags of all participants in the contact list. All participants with matching tags of "Freshman" or "OGL" will be added into the filtered participant list, enabling the user to view all freshmen or OGLs in the contact list.

The following Sequence diagram below will explain how the `list_f` command works in detail.

image::ListParticipantCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Sequence Diagram for listing Freshmen command_

An example usage of the `list_f` command is as follows:

*Step 1:* The user launches the application. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state.

*Step 2:* The user enters the `list_f` command . The `list_f` command calls the `FindingParticipantPredicate` class and searches all tags of each participant for "Freshman".

*Step 3:* The `updateFilteredPersonList()` takes in this predicate and the `getFilteredPersonList()` is called to give the list of Freshmen in the contact list

The implementation is similar for the `list_o` command with the use of `FindingOglPredicate` instead where the searched tag is "OGL".

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Separate management of freshmen and OGLs

* *Alternative 1:* Create 2 separate lists containing freshmen and OGLs separately, in addition to a full list containing all participants.
* Pros: Less computationally expensive to obtain separate lists of freshmen and OGLs
* Cons: Involves greater code complexity to update any contact details, with greater room for error, and requires more memory and storage
* *Alternative 2 (current choice):* Store all participants in the same list.
* Pros: Smaller code base needed, and allows for participants who are neither OGLs nor Freshmen (such as camp directors or camp commandants) to be added
* Cons: More computationally expensive to access lists of freshmen and lists of OGLs

We decided to go ahead with *Alternative 2* as it was easier to implement. It would not require creation of switch cases for the UI to display the respective lists and would not require unnecessarily long codes to filter out freshmen and OGLs from the participant list. The pros of doing *Alternative 2* outweighs the pros of doing *Alternative 1* hence the decision to implement the latter.

===== Aspect: Editing or deleting participants

* *Alternative 1:* Editing and deleting by name.
* Pros: More intuitive for the user to edit and delete a participant by name
* Cons: Greater complexity required to handle multiple participants who have the same partial name, or user must specify participant's full name

* *Alternative 2(current choice):* Editing and deleting by index.
* Pros: Specifies the exact participant to be edited or deleted
* Cons: Must be used with other commands such as `find` to obtain the index of the desired participant

We decided to go with *Alternative 2* as it meant there was no need to check for the full name of the participant and so fewer complications as in indexing, each participant has a unique index.
//end::PartManagement[]

//tag::GroupHouseManagement[]
=== Group and House Management

*FOP Manager* supports group and house commands, to reflect the structure of an actual Freshmen Orientation camp. Group and house management refer to how groups and houses are created and modified, as well as viewed, and how they support the addition of participants.

==== Current Implementation

In *FOP Manager*, groups and houses can be added, edited and deleted.

Add

* `add_h` creates a new house and adds it to the `UniqueHouseList` in the `AddressBook` object.
* `add_g` adds a new group with its corresponding house name to the `UniqueGroupList` in the `AddressBook` object.

Edit

* `edit_h` edits the name of a house in `UniqueHouseList`, as well as changes the house name of all groups within the house in `UniqueGroupList`.
* `edit_g` edits the name of a group in `UniqueGroupList`, as well as changes the group name of all participants with that group name in `UniqueParticipantList`.

Delete

* Deleting of house objects require there to be no groups within that house.
* Deleting of group objects require there to be no participants within that group.

Groups and houses can be viewed in different manners:

* Viewing houses and groups
** `view_h` and `view_g` simply displays the houses and groups stored in `UniqueHouseList` and `UniqueGroupList` respectively.
* Listing participants in a group
** `list_g` uses similar logic to `list_o` and `list_f`, implemented by using an entered group name as a predicate that searches through all the `Group` fields of participants, and updates the `filteredPersons` list with participants with the matching group name.
** Entering `list_g empty` lists all participants without a group yet by searching for participants with an empty group name.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storage of group and house lists

* *Alternative 1:* Storing groups and houses within a single list of houses that contain differing number of groups
** Pros: Easy management of data
** Cons: Violates separation of concerns principle by requiring access and modification made to houses, whenever only group level data is required
* *Alternative 2 (current choice):* Storing groups and houses in 2 separate lists
** Pros: House objects are not affected by the operations done to the groups stored within it
** Cons: More computationally expensive to identify the groups within a house.

===== Aspect: Deleting a group object requirements

* *Alternative 1:* No requirements when groups are deleted.
** Pros: User can delete a group much more easily
** Cons: Participants in the deleted group will belong to no group
* *Alternative 2 (current choice):* Requires a group to contain no participants before it can be deleted.
** Pros: User can be sure to not delete a group with participants in it accidentally
** Cons: Participants must be manually removed from the group before being deleted

[NOTE]
Camp organizers rarely intend to remove a filled group. Requiring a group to be empty before being deleted acts as a fail-safe to ensure that filled groups are not accidentally removed, resulting in participants having to be manually added back to the group.

===== Aspect: Duplicate group names under different houses

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Duplicate group names are not allowed.
** Pros: Groups can be searched for by name without specifying its house
** Cons: Simple names such as 1 and 2 cannot be used for different houses at initial planning stage
* *Alternative 2:* Duplicate group names under different houses are allowed.
** Pros: User can easily name groups without too much thought
** Cons: User must always specify house name when searching for a specific group

//end::GroupHouseManagement[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature

==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th participant in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new participant. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the participant was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the participant being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

//tag::randomize[]
=== Randomized Group Allocation

*FOP Manager* has a `randomize` command, which allows the Project Director to automatically assign all participants to a group.

==== Current Implementation

The `randomize` is achieved by coding a sequence of steps to achieve the allocation of groups to participants:
* Creates a list of integer based index. This is to simulate the participants.
* Shuffles the list of index using a seed generated from SecureRandom. This is to ensure the result is to avoid possible similar results for every reshuffle.
* Simulate the edit command to update the group details of all participants. This is done by programmatically executing the `edit` command, but only for the group attributes of the participants.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Updating group attribute of participants

* *Alternative 1:* Use the same way as how the `edit` command works
** Pros: No internal coupling
** Cons: Unnecessary recoding
* *Alternative 2 (current choice):* Programmatically simulate the `edit` command
** Pros: Lesser code and better maintainance of the editing feature
** Cons: Internal coupling within the component

===== Aspect: Shuffling of participants

* *Alternative 1:* Shuffling the actual
** Pros: Unidentifiable
** Cons: Uses even more computational resource and more complex coding as the current list of participant is
unmodifiable.
* *Alternative 2 (current choice):* Creating a list of integer based index to simulate participants
** Pros: Less computational intensive as dealing with native data type
** Cons: Uses slightly more memory at that point of time

//end::randomize[]

// tag::statistic[]
=== Statistic feature
The 'stat' command allows FOP Manager users to view the statistic of camp participants regarding their age, major and sex in a graphical manner.
==== Current Implementation

The Statistic feature is facilitated by `AddressBook`. It has three HashMaps, containing the number of each categories in the participants' age, major and sex. These Map are generated after every call of the
`stat` command. After command call, these data is loaded into three different pie charts and shown on the UI.

The following sequence diagram show hows the 'stat' command works in details :

image::StatisticUpdateSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: How to update the data of the AddressBook

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use a loop to loop through the `UniquePersonList` to get the data of everyone
** Pros: Easy to implement, guaranteed to get the correct data every time.
** Cons: Takes longer time and more computational power to get the result. However, since this function is unlikely to be
used many times and the number of participants in a camp is not too large, the drawbacks is acceptable

* **Alternative 2 :** Update charts data after each commands that modify it.
** Pros: Quick runtime, does not require much changes to the codebase.
** Cons: We must ensure that the data is updated after each command.
// end::statistic[]

// tag::export[]
=== Export Feature

The Export feature will allow the FOP Manager user to export the data into an excel file and distribute to other relevant people involved in the FOP. This way, data can be distributed and raw data untouched except by the Project Director or other camp organisers who are given the access to the raw data.

Participant contact details can be exported in different manners:

* `export`: Exports all participants' contacts into an Excel Spreadsheet
* `export_f`: Exports all freshmen contacts into an Excel Spreadsheet
* `export_o`: Exports all OGL contacts into an Excel Spreadsheet

The following is an Activity Diagram to summarize what happens when the `export` command is entered.

image::ExportCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Activity Diagram for exporting command_

==== Current Implementation
* A third-party library 'Apache.poi' was integrated into the project to enable easy creation of excel files through Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In this case, the library will enable the creation of HSSF Workbook.
* The `export` command will call a function from a class `WriteToExcel` to start the creation of the HSSF Workbook and the addition of all the participants found on the participant list to the Workbook, with the respective objects to the participant class added to the correct column. The system will get the current directory path and add the path name to the proposed file name that end with ".xls". The file will thus be successfully saved in the current user directory.

The following Sequence diagram below will explain how the `export` command works in detail.

image::ExportCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Sequence Diagram for exporting command_

An example usage of the command is as follows:

*Step 1:* The user launches the application. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state.

*Step 2:* The user enters the `export` command . The `export` command updates the filtered list with the predicate to show all participants in the address book.

*Step 3:* The filtered list is obtained in the command. The export command calls the `WriteToExcel` class's `WriteExcelSheet()`. This will set the directory, create the Excel Workbook and Sheet, the file name, the cells and rows with the titles for the FOP Manager.

*Step 4:* `WriteExcelSheet()` calls `WriteDataIntoExcelSheet()` which writes the values from the filtered participant list into the Excel Sheet.

*Step 5:* Returning to `WriteExcelSheet()`, the file is output to user's current directory as an .xls file.

==== Design Consideration
Only one way was considered for the implementation of Export feature, which involved importing the third-party library.
// end:: export[]

// tag::import[]
=== Import Feature

Sometimes FOP Project Directors realise they need to add many participants' contacts that they gathered and usually they gather the contacts through sign up links that allow for exportation into Excel spreadsheets. Manually added the large influx of participants is troublesome. Hence, with the Import feature, FOP Project Directors can import the data of Non-duplicate people from an excel file into the FOP Manager. This makes adding of contacts easier.

The following is an Activity Diagram to summarize what happens when the `import` command is entered.

image::ImportCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Activity Diagram for the importing command_

==== Current Implementation
* A third-party library 'Apache.poi' was integrated into the project to enable easy creation of excel files through Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In this case, the library will enable the creation of HSSF Workbook.
* The `import` command will call a function from a class `WriteToExcel` to start the reading from a HSSF Workbook found in the current directory path, with the file name "FOP_MANAGER_LIST.xls".
* The cell value from the respective heading/columns are read into their respective string and `person` is created with these strings.
* The `person` is added to a `List<Person>` and each `person` is added into the `Address Book`.

The following Sequence diagram below will explain how the `import` command works in detail.

image::ImportCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Sequence Diagram for importing command_

An example usage of the command is as follows:

*Step 1:* The user launches the application. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state.

*Step 2:* The user enters the `import` command . The `import` command calls the `WriteToExcel` class's `ReadFromExcel()`. This will open the file of the default set name from the set directory.

*Step 3:* The Excel sheets is checked for the correct headings and then the cell's values are read to create each `person`. Each `person` is added to a `List<Person>` which will be returned to the Import command.

*Step 4:* The `import` command adds each non-duplicate person into the FOP Manager.

** One interesting usage of both `import` and `export` feature will be to retain and retrieve contacts. For instance, after exporting the data, we can clear. We can then import the contacts if needed.
** Another interesting usage is for manual edit of the details of multiple contacts. We can clear the Address Book and then `import` command to import the data.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all participants in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/model/participant/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a participant, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/model/participant/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each participant, and remove the `tag` from each participant.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last participant in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside participant cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of participants when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of participants whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of participants status bar.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/storage/JsonAddressBookStorage.java[`JsonAddressBookStorage`] class.
* Solution

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a participant specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first participant to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first participant.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/major/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/major/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each participant later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/model/participant/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/model/participant/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/model/participant/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/model/participant/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the participant will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `data/addressbook.json` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `JsonAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/storage/JsonAdaptedPerson.java[`JsonAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new JSON field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.json`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.json`, `validAddressBook.json` etc., such that the JSON tests will not fail due to a missing `remark` field.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/major/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/model/participant/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/major/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the participant that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/major/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/major/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/major/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a participant.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
